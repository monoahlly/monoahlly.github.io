Here, the player is given the choice to take the axe they find in a tree along the way. It is needed to progress past the river, but if the player continues holding onto it afterwards, they will get a game over when they encounter the owner of it.

To make it back home, the player must take the axe, use it at the river, discard it, and give the strange man the name that they entered at the beginning.
